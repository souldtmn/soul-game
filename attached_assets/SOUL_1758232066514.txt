⚔️ SOUL: Pyre of Determination
Game Design Document (Complete Blueprint)

1. Core Philosophy
    • Not a game, but a trial. Brutal, unforgiving, artistic.
    • No pacifism, no shortcuts. Genocide is the only path.
    • Every choice — kill, burn, revive — must feel like sacrifice.
    • By the end, even victory feels hollow. That emptiness is the art.

2. Gameplay Loop
    1. Explore hostile, decaying environments.
    2. Hunt → every monster must die.
    3. Countdown → visible number of monsters left, becomes distorted as genocide nears.
    4. Boss → appears only when genocide complete.
    5. Death → choice between:
        ◦ Restart (permadeath).
        ◦ Burn SOUL (on-chain) to revive → costly and corrupting.

3. Currency & Token Integration
SOUL (on-chain token)
    • Used for burn-to-revive.
    • Used for ritual/global events (boss summons, pyre burns).
    • Manual burns only (pump.fun launch = no auto-tax). Burns verified by sending to burn address 11111111111111111111111111111111.
Ash / Fragments (in-game)
    • Earned by killing monsters & finishing areas.
    • Used for temporary upgrades (weapons, abilities).
    • Not on-chain → keeps base game free-to-play.

4. Burn-to-Revive Mechanics
Costs (escalating)
    • Area 1: 500 → 1000 → 2500 SOUL.
    • Area 2: 1000 → 2500 → 5000 SOUL.
    • Area 3: 5000 → 10,000 → 25,000 SOUL.
    • After 3rd revive → permadeath, restart run.
Penalties
    • Reviving permanently corrupts screen, whispers, and endings.
    • Reviving too much → HUD elements vanish, screen fragments, music drowned by whispers.
    • Heavy revival leads to corrupted ending: whispers mock, “You don’t live — you only burn.”
Ritual Burns
    • Community-wide events: burn totals unlock boss fights, story layers, or cosmetic corruption.
    • Global whisper/music intensity tied to total burns.
Leaderboard
    • Top sacrificers recognized with roles/titles (Watcher, Ashborn, Flamebearer).

5. Countdown Behavior
Area 1: Hollow Vale
    • 14–10: Clear white pixel font.
    • 9–5: Flickers, CRT static.
    • 4–2: Distorted glyphs.
    • 1: Unreadable static, whisper: “Only one remains…”.
    • 0: Counter disappears → silence → boss spawns.
Area 2: Shattered Crypt
    • 14–10: Icy blue counter, stable.
    • 9–6: Freezes, cracks, reforms.
    • 5–3: Appears in random screen locations.
    • 1: Full frost overlay, whisper shrieks.
    • 0: Counter gone → chains snap → boss awakens.
Area 3: Abyss Below
    • 13–10: Counter fractured.
    • 7: Flickers between true number & “0.”
    • 3: Cycles random numbers rapidly.
    • 1: Counter replaced with “ENOUGH.”
    • 0: Screen collapse, whispers scream, boss fight begins.

6. Whispers System
Progression
    • Early: Subliminal, barely audible.
    • Mid: Audible after each kill: “Keep going…”.
    • Late: Overlapping, distorted voices.
    • Final stretch: Words crawl visibly across screen edges.
Burn-Triggered
    • 1st revive: “Your SOUL burns brighter…”.
    • 2nd revive: “The Pyre owns you…”.
    • 3rd revive: “You don’t live — you only burn.”.
Area-Specific
    • Vale: Whisper escalation matches countdown.
    • Crypt: Colder, sharper → “Frozen. Forgotten. Buried.”
    • Abyss: Layered voices → “It’s already over.” / “SOUL burns, and nothing remains.”

7. Music Design
Instruments
    • Piano (detunes over time).
    • Strings (drone → vibrato → screech).
    • Percussion (heartbeat → irregular panic → chains).
    • Noise/static (grows as genocide nears).
    • Whisper vocals (hidden → dominant).
Area 1: Hollow Vale
    • 14–10: Minimal piano + drone.
    • 9–5: Detuning, irregular percussion.
    • 4–2: Reversed notes, static pulses.
    • 1: Pure distortion, collapses to silence.
    • Boss: Chains as percussion, oppressive drone, whispers hidden.
Area 2: Shattered Crypt
    • 14–10: Hollow chimes + drones.
    • 9–6: Glass cracking rhythm.
    • 5–3: Frozen heartbeats, static builds.
    • 1: Fade out → ice crack.
    • Boss: Metallic clangs, faint choir → silence mid-fight → screaming choir at climax.
Area 3: Abyss Below
    • 13–10: Sub-bass hum, faint.
    • 9–7: Distorted echoes of earlier themes.
    • 6–3: Static overtakes, percussion becomes glitches.
    • 1: Silence → faint heartbeat.
    • Boss:
        ◦ Phase 1: Deep bass drones.
        ◦ Phase 2: Chains + static shrieks.
        ◦ Phase 3: Silence → whispers circle in 3D.
    • Ending: Single distorted piano note fading endlessly.
Burn Audio
    • 1st burn: Track skips, restarts detuned.
    • 2nd burn: Distortion layers added, percussion speeds up.
    • 3rd burn: Whispers drown entire soundtrack.

8. Visual Decay
Environments
    • Vale: Forest decays → barren wasteland → gray void.
    • Crypt: Ice walls glitch, faces press out → collapse into darkness.
    • Abyss: Platforms break → stars collapse → screen fragments into static.
Revives
    • 1st: Brief crack flash.
    • 2nd: Crack stays, glowing faintly.
    • 3rd: Screen shattered, blurred, static overlay permanent.
Bosses
    • Vale: Chains snap in sync with music → silence.
    • Crypt: Frozen throne shatters → darkness revealed.
    • Abyss: The screen itself becomes the boss. HUD, visuals, sound stripped away.

9. Level Design
Area 1: Hollow Vale
    • Monsters:
        ◦ Lurkers (10) – weak, whisper triggers.
        ◦ Ashbeasts (3) – hound packs, real threat.
        ◦ Watcher Fragment (1) – escalation trigger.
    • Boss: Wraith of Vale → invisible/visible phases, whisper attacks.
    • End: Forest drained of life → silence.
Area 2: Shattered Crypt
    • Monsters:
        ◦ Frostwraiths (8) – slow player with frost trails.
        ◦ Gravehounds (4) – burrow + leap attacks.
        ◦ Forgotten (2) – frozen humanoids with massive swings.
    • Boss: Keeper of Silence → silence mid-fight, whispers return at climax.
    • End: Crypt collapses into abyss.
Area 3: Abyss Below
    • Monsters:
        ◦ Echo Shades (6) – mimic player’s movements.
        ◦ Ashborn (4) – burning skeletons, red flare.
        ◦ Watcher’s Husk (2) – whisper directly at player.
        ◦ Last Remnant (1) – frail figure, triggers collapse.
    • Boss: The Abyss / The Maw of SOUL → arena collapse, whispers as attacks, silence as weapon.
    • Endings:
        ◦ Low revives: Whisper → “You endured.”
        ◦ High revives: Corrupted ending → “You don’t live — you only burn.”
        ◦ Failure: Whisper → “…but nobody came.”

11. Tone & Identity
    • No comfort. No reset. No mercy.

    • Environments decay into void.
    • By the end, the player has nothing left but Determination — and the burn mechanic itself.
