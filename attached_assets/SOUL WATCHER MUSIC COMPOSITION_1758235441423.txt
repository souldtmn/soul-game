Music Design — SOUL: Pyre of Determination
Core Instruments

Piano → slowly detunes, becomes unstable.

Strings → evolve from drone → vibrato → screech.

Percussion → heartbeat → irregular panic → chains.

Noise/Static → rises as genocide nears, oppressive texture.

Whisper Vocals → hidden at first, later dominate entire mix.

Area Soundscapes

Area 1: Hollow Vale

14–10: Minimal piano + sustained drone.

9–5: Detuning creeps in, percussion grows irregular.

4–2: Reversed piano notes, static pulses intrude.

1: Pure distortion collapse → silence.

Boss: Chains used as percussion, oppressive drone, whispers hidden.

Area 2: Shattered Crypt

14–10: Hollow chimes + deep drones.

9–6: Glass cracking rhythm introduced.

5–3: Frozen heartbeat percussion, static builds.

1: Fade-out → sudden ice crack.

Boss: Metallic clangs, faint choir → mid-fight silence → screaming choir climax.

Area 3: Abyss Below

13–10: Sub-bass hum, faint and cavernous.

9–7: Distorted echoes of earlier themes (Vale + Crypt motifs).

6–3: Static overtakes, percussion glitches out.

1: Silence → faint heartbeat.

Boss:

Phase 1: Deep bass drones.

Phase 2: Chains + static shrieks.

Phase 3: Silence → whispers circle in binaural/3D.

Ending: Single distorted piano note fading endlessly.

Burn Audio Progression

1st Burn: Track skips, restarts slightly detuned.

2nd Burn: Distortion layers stack, percussion accelerates.

3rd Burn: Whispers overwhelm, drowning entire soundtrack.

AI Implementation Notes

To make this real, we’ll need two tool layers:

Composition/structure → symbolic or MIDI-based (e.g. AIVA, Orb Composer, Soundraw, or even MuseNet-style models) to structure the flow.

Sound design & rendering → granular audio AI or synthesis (e.g. Riffusion, Stable Audio, Kaiber Audio, ElevenLabs for whispers, and custom VSTs for chains/static/glass).

We could also use game engines’ adaptive audio layers (like FMOD/Wwise) to:

Tie player genocide progress → static level.

Sync Burn mechanic → track corruption in real-time.

Trigger boss phase audio events (e.g., silence drop → choir cut in).
