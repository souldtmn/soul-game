# üïπ SOUL Game ‚Äî Changelog & Devlog

This file tracks the history and evolution of the SOUL Game project ‚Äî from its earliest concepts to current development.  
Every hammer strike, every cleanup, every new feature forged into the code is recorded here. ‚öîÔ∏èüî•

## Origins  
- **Concept Birth**: Inspired by *Undertale* and *Punch-Out!* mechanics, wrapped in the SOUL mythos.  
- **Core Idea**: Player‚Äôs actions shape phases (Smile, Cold, Mercy, Hunger, Silence).  
- **Combat Loop**: Real-time dodge / defend / attack with telegraph inputs.  
- **World Design**: 2.5D overworld, SNES / Undertale pixel-art vibe.  
- **Kingdom Lore**: Sand ‚Üí Steel evolution, Yume, Watcher integrated.  

---

## Early Development  
- **Prototype HUDs**: Multiple overlapping HUDs (cluttered, later trimmed).  
- **First Combat Tests**: Added `useCombat` store for attack/defend state.  
- **TelegraphDefendRing**: Visual ring added for defense timing feedback.  
- **Boss Intro Overlay**: First attempt at cinematic transitions.  

---

## Refactor Era (Agent 3 ‚Üí Cleanup)  
- **Problem**: Code was bloated, HUD cluttered, overlapping imports, unstable.  
- **Solution**: Started systematic cleanup with test harnesses.  
- **App.tsx Slimdown**:  
  - TEST toggles for overlays & scenes.  
  - ErrorBoundary for safe dev iteration.  
- **Blue Cube Test Scene**: Minimal canvas for debugging core rendering.  

---

## Debug & Dev Tools  
- **DebugHitCircle**: New modular tool for hitbox/hurtbox testing.  
- **ParryRing (ex-TelegraphDefendRing)**: Archived for future perfect-guard mechanic.  
- **CombatArenaBackdrop**: Simple flat arena for combat clarity.  

---

## Today‚Äôs Milestone  
- **Unified Combat Store**: Fixed `endDefend` vs `stopDefend` confusion.  
- **Game.tsx Cleanup**: Clear overworld vs combat split, minimal clutter.  
- **Code Style**: Leaner, modular, future-proof.  
- **Testing Infrastructure**: Ready toggles for rapid iteration.  

---

## Next Planned Steps  
- Add toggle flag for DebugHitCircle directly in Game.tsx.  
- Refactor HUD into ‚Äúbase HUD + context overlays.‚Äù  
- Escape key ‚Üí exit combat for testing.  
- Revisit BossIntro & cinematic transitions.  
- Long-term: Implement ParryRing as a timing-based guard mechanic.  

---

## Vision Ahead  
The SOUL game evolves into a **clean, modular combat system** with:  
- Tight telegraph input mechanics.  
- Pixel-perfect hitbox/hurtbox testing.  
- Overworld ‚Üí combat transitions.  
- Lore-driven mechanics tied to player‚Äôs phases & choices.
